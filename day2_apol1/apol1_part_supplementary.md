# 🧬 Supplementary Exercise: p.N264K

The **p.N264K** variant (**rs73885316**) is a **rare missense mutation** in the *APOL1* gene (Asparagine → Lysine at position 264).  
Unlike the well-known **G1** and **G2** risk alleles, **p.N264K** is not itself associated with kidney disease risk — rather, it appears to act as a **protective modifier**.

---

## 🔍 Context

- The **p.N264K** variant occurs in the **SRA-interacting domain** of APOL1, which is crucial for the protein’s trypanolytic activity.  
- Functional studies suggest that **p.N264K** can **reduce APOL1-mediated cytotoxicity** without fully compromising trypanosome resistance.  
- This variant tends to **co-occur on the same haplotype as G2**, and less commonly with G1, suggesting a possible **modifier effect** on G2-associated risk.  

**Key relationships:**
- 🧩 **p.N264K + G2** → Often found together (on the same haplotype).  
- 🔬 **p.N264K + G1** → Rare association.  
- 🧫 **p.N264K + G0** → Sometimes observed, usually in individuals of African ancestry without high-risk alleles.

## 🌍 Population Distribution

- **p.N264K** is observed **almost exclusively in African ancestry populations**.  
- The **highest frequencies** have been reported in **West and Central African populations**, though still typically **below 5%**.  
- It is **rare or absent** in **non-African** populations (e.g., European, Asian, or Native American).  
- Because it frequently occurs with **G2**, it shows slightly higher prevalence in regions where **G2** is common — particularly in **East Africa**.

## 🧠 Application

Using your dataset that includes **p.N264K genotypes** (rs73885316) and **APOL1 G1/G2 status**:

1. **Determine** with which high-risk allele (G1 or G2) the p.N264K variant most frequently co-occurs.  
2. **Compute allele frequencies** of p.N264K by population or ancestry group.  
3. **Interpret** the results in the context of:
   - Evolutionary history of APOL1 variants,  
   - The potential **protective role** of p.N264K in mitigating kidney disease risk among G2 / G1 carriers.
