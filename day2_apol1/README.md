# Training exercise for APOL1

## üåç General Context


The **APOL1 (Apolipoprotein L1)** gene, located on **chromosome 22 (22q12.3)**, encodes a protein involved in **innate immunity** and **protection against Trypanosoma parasites** that cause *African sleeping sickness*.  

However, two common coding variants ‚Äî known as the **G1** and **G2** **risk alleles** ‚Äî have been **strongly associated with increased susceptibility to kidney diseases**, particularly in individuals of **African ancestry**.  

- **G1 variant** ‚Üí consists of two missense mutations:  
  - `rs73885319 (S342G)`  
  - `rs60910145 (I384M)`  

- **G2 variant** ‚Üí involves a **6‚Äìbase pair deletion** (`rs71785313`) that removes two amino acids (**N388** and **Y389**).  

üß¨ **High-risk genotypes** ‚Äî individuals carrying **two risk alleles** (`G1/G1`, `G2/G2`, or `G1/G2`) ‚Äî have a **significantly increased risk** of developing:  
- **Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)**  
- **Hypertension-attributed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)**  
- **HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)**  

These variants illustrate a striking example of an **evolutionary trade-off**, where **protection against infection** came at the **cost of kidney disease risk**.

---

### üåê Population Frequency and Selection

The frequency of **APOL1 high-risk alleles** varies markedly across populations, reflecting their **evolutionary history** and **selective pressures**:

- Found **almost exclusively in individuals of recent African ancestry**.  
- Combined **risk allele frequency** ranges from **10% to >40%** in **West African** populations, where exposure to *Trypanosoma brucei* was historically common.  
- **Rare or absent** in **non-African populations** (Europeans, Asians, Indigenous Americans).  
- Within Africa, distribution is **heterogeneous**:  
  - **Higher** in **West and Central Africa** (e.g., *Yoruba, Igbo*).  
  - **Lower** in **East and Southern Africa**, mirroring the geographic spread of *T. brucei gambiense* and *T. b. rhodesiense*.  

üß© This variability highlights **balancing selection** ‚Äî risk alleles were **maintained** in populations where they **conferred resistance to trypanosome infection**, despite their **negative effect on kidney function**.

---

### üß™ The p.N264K Protective Variant
```text 
rs73885316 (chr22:36265628 C > A, p.N264K, gnomAD AFR allele frequency = 0.03)
```

A third **APOL1 variant of emerging interest**, **p.N264K (`rs73885316`)**, is located in the **SRA-interacting domain** of the protein.

- Unlike **G1** and **G2**, which **increase kidney disease risk**,  
  **p.N264K** appears to be a **protective variant** that may **mitigate APOL1 cytotoxic effects**.  
- The **asparagine-to-lysine substitution (N‚ÜíK at position 264)** changes the **charge and conformation** of the protein, affecting its interaction with the *Trypanosoma brucei* **SRA protein**.  
- Functional studies suggest that **p.N264K** can **reduce APOL1-induced cell toxicity** by modulating **ion channel activity** or **intracellular localization**, without fully compromising **trypanolytic function**.  

üìä **Population studies** show:
- **p.N264K** occurs at **low frequencies** in individuals of **African ancestry**.  
- It often coexists on the **same haplotype background** as **G1 or G2**.  
- Its presence has been associated with **reduced kidney disease risk** among **APOL1 high-risk carriers**, making it a **promising target** for understanding **genetic modifiers** and for **therapeutic development**.

---

‚úÖ **Key Takeaway:**  
The **APOL1 gene** exemplifies how **evolutionary pressures from infectious disease** (trypanosome exposure) can shape **genetic diversity** and influence **modern disease susceptibility**, especially in **African populations**.



## Exercise : general description

Your collaborator, Prof. Nephro Log, has sequenced a dataset including individuals from different continents and ethnic backgrounds using whole-genome sequencing. The goal is to estimate the prevalence of APOL1 high-risk variants and the p.N264K variant. However, your collaborator does not have the necessary skills to analyze the dataset.

You have received the following files:

* A VCF file containing the genotyped data 
* A population information file describing the population or ethnic background of each individual
* Files can be found on [Github](https://github.com/jeantristanb/kidneygenafrica_course_january_2026/tree/main/day2_apol1/Data)

The aim of this work is to:

- **Understand the VCF format** and explore the main tools available to manipulate and process Variant Call Format (VCF) files.

- **Extract individual SNP genotypes** from the VCF corresponding to the **APOL1 risk variants**:
  - `rs73885319`
  - `rs60910145`
  - `rs71785313`

- **Compute APOL1 genotypes (G0, G1, G2)** for each individual and classify them according to the **recessive risk model**, where:
  - Individuals carrying **two risk alleles** (`G1/G1`, `G2/G2`, or `G1/G2`) are considered **high-risk**.
  - Individuals with other genotypes (`G0/G0`, `G0/G1`, or `G0/G2`) are considered **low-risk**.

- **Estimate allele and genotype frequencies by population** to evaluate the distribution and variability of **APOL1 risk alleles** across groups.

## üìÑ Description of the VCF File

The **Variant Call Format (VCF)** is a standard text file format used in bioinformatics to represent genetic variation data such as **single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)**, **insertions**, and **deletions** identified in one or more samples.

A VCF file is divided into two main sections:

1. **Header section**  
   Begins with lines starting with `##` that describe metadata (e.g., reference genome, annotation sources, file format version).  
   The final header line starts with `#CHROM` and defines the column names, including sample identifiers.

2. **Data section**  
   Each subsequent line represents a genomic variant with the following standard columns:
   - `CHROM`: Chromosome name  
   - `POS`: Genomic position  
   - `ID`: Variant identifier (e.g., rsID)  
   - `REF`: Reference allele  
   - `ALT`: Alternate allele(s)  
   - `QUAL`: Quality score for the variant call  
   - `FILTER`: Filter status of the variant  
   - `INFO`: Additional information and annotations  
   - `FORMAT`: Describes the structure of genotype fields  
   - **Sample columns**: Genotype data and related information for each individual (e.g., `0/0`, `0/1`, `1/1`)

### üß¨ Genotype Representation and Phasing

Each genotype is represented using allele codes:
- `0` = reference allele  
- `1` = alternate allele  

For example:
- `0/0` ‚Üí homozygous reference  
- `0/1` ‚Üí heterozygous  
- `1/1` ‚Üí homozygous alternate  

The **separator symbol** between alleles conveys information about **phasing**:
- `0/1` ‚Üí **unphased** genotype (the origin of each allele‚Äîmaternal or paternal‚Äîis unknown).  
- `0|1` ‚Üí **phased** genotype, indicating the alleles are assigned to specific haplotypes (e.g., `0` on the maternal chromosome and `1` on the paternal).  

Phasing is particularly important in **haplotype-based analyses**, such as imputation, recombination rate estimation, or studies of compound heterozygosity.  
Phased VCFs are usually the output of tools such as **SHAPEIT**, **BEAGLE**, or **Eagle**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è File Handling

VCF files are often compressed (`.vcf.gz`) and indexed (`.tbi`) for efficient storage and querying.  
They can be manipulated using tools such as:
- **bcftools** ‚Äî for querying, filtering, merging, and annotation  
- **vcftools** ‚Äî for quality control and summary statistics  
- **plink** ‚Äî for genotype conversion, association testing, and frequency computation
- **R** ‚Äî for conversion, association testing, and frequency computation and small dataset
- **python** ‚Äî for conversion, association testing, and frequency computation and small dataset

### üß© Example of a VCF File

Below is a simplified example of a VCF file showing both **unphased** (`/`) and **phased** (`|`) genotypes.

## Part.1 Extract APOL1 Variants 

### Variants

[**APOL1**](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000100342;r=22:36253071-36267530)  
is a gene located on **chromosome 22: 36,253,071‚Äì36,267,530 (GRCh38/hg38)**.  
It encodes Apolipoprotein L1, involved in innate immunity and parasitic resistance.  
Certain variants in this gene‚Äîknown as **G1** and **G2**‚Äîare associated with increased kidney disease risk in individuals of recent African ancestry.

| rsID         | Chr | Position (hg38) | REF ‚Üí ALT        | Amino Acid Change            | Functional Role         | Description |
|--------------|-----|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **rs73885319** | 22  | 36,265,860     | A ‚Üí G            | p.S342G (Ser ‚Üí Gly)          | **G1** variant           | One of two missense mutations defining the G1 haplotype. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} |
| **rs60910145** | 22  | 36,265,988     | T ‚Üí G            | p.I384M (Ile ‚Üí Met)          | **G1** variant           | Occurs in strong LD with rs73885319; together define G1. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| **rs71785313** | 22  | 36,265,995     | AATAATT‚Üí A (6 bp del) | p.N388_Y389del            | **G2** variant           | In-frame 6 bp deletion removing two amino acids; defines G2. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
| **rs73885316** | 22  | 36,265,628     | C ‚Üí A            | p.N264K (Asn ‚Üí Lys)          | **Modifier / Protective**| Rare variant; may attenuate APOL1 risk when co-inherited. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |
| ‚Äî             | ‚Äî   | ‚Äî              | ‚Äî                | ‚Äî                            | **G0 (Reference)**       | Reference haplotype: neither G1 nor G2 present; low-risk. |

#### üß† Notes
- **G1** is defined by the *combined presence* of rs73885319 (A‚ÜíG) and rs60910145 (T‚ÜíG) on the same haplotype. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **G2** is an *in-frame deletion* (rs71785313: AATAATT‚Üí A) removing residues N388 and Y389. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Individuals carrying **two risk alleles** (G1/G1, G2/G2, or G1/G2) are classified as **high-risk** under a recessive model.  
- The **p.N264K (rs73885316)** variant is a *potential protective modifier*, observed in low frequency in African ancestry populations.  
- Coordinates correspond to the **GRCh38 (hg38)** reference genome.

### üß¨ Application : Extract APOL1 Risk Alleles (Including p.N264K) from a VCF File

#### üß† Objective

From a collaborator‚Äôs VCF file, extract the **genomic positions** and **individual genotypes** for the **APOL1 risk variants**, including **p.N264K (rs73885319)**.

---

#### üìÇ Files

The file `Data/chr22.apol1.vcf` contains approximately **3,000 samples** with variants located around the **APOL1 gene**.  
All genotypes in this file are **phased**, meaning that alleles are represented as `0|1`, `1|0`, or `1|1`.

---

#### üß™ Steps

Using **R** (or any equivalent tool), extract from the provided VCF file:

1. The **positions** and **IDs** of the APOL1 variants of interest.  
2. The **individual phased genotypes** (e.g., `0|1`, `1|1`, or `0|0`).  
3. Replace genotype encodings:  
   - `0` ‚Üí Reference allele (**REF**)  
   - `1` ‚Üí Alternate allele (**ALT**)  
4. Create a summary table containing **REF/ALT alleles per sample** for each variant.  
5. Save the final table as `APOL1_risk_genotypes.csv`.

üí¨ *Note:*  
R is not mandatory. You can use other tools (e.g., `bcftools`, `awk`, or `plink`, `python`) to achieve the same result.

---

### üí° Clue

Using **R** is one of the easiest ways to handle data programmatically.  
However, it can be limited when dealing with **very large datasets** or **complex string manipulations**.  
For this exercise, R provides convenient tools to complete the task effectively.

---

#### üìò Reading Data

- For large files (including compressed `.gz` files), use the `fread()` function from the **data.table** package.  
  Install the required libraries:

  ```r
  install.packages(c("data.table", "R.utils"))
  library(data.table)
  ```

- Functions like `fread()` or `read.table()` require a **consistent separator** and a **header**.  
  In some datasets, the header line starts after several commented lines (e.g., lines beginning with `#`).  
  You can skip these lines using `skip` or search for the line containing `"CHR"`.

  ```r
  # Skip lines until the header line containing "CHR"
  header_line <- system('zcat Data/chr22.apol1.vcf,gz|grep "#"',intern=T) 
  data <- fread("Data/chr22.apol1.vcf,gz", skip = length(header_line) - 1)
  ```

---

### üß© Splitting Genotype Strings

- The `strsplit()` function splits genotype strings such as `"0|1"` or `"1|1"` into alleles.  
  It returns a **list**, so use `sapply()` or `do.call()` to convert it to a list with geno 1.

  ```r
  genotypes <- c("0|1", "1|1", "0|0")
  split_geno <- strsplit(genotypes, "|", fixed)
  geno1 <- sapply(split_geno, function(x)x[1]))
  print(geno1)
  ```

- For a short tutorial on lists and string manipulation, see:  
  üëâ [Software Carpentry: Supplementary Data Structures](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/13-supp-data-structures.html)

---

üí¨ *Tip:* Combining `data.table::fread()` and `strsplit()` makes R powerful for extracting and manipulating genotype data efficiently.

## Part.2 Excercice : Built risk allele 

### üß¨ APOL1 Haplotype Definitions

This table summarizes the **allelic composition** of the main APOL1 haplotypes  
(**G0**, **G1**, and **G2**) across the key variants defining kidney disease risk.

| Haplotype | rs73885319 (p.S342G) | rs60910145 (p.I384M) | rs71785313 (p.N388_Y389del) | Description |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| **G0 (Reference)** | A (REF) | T (REF) | AATAATT (REF) | Reference haplotype ‚Äî no risk variants; low-risk. |
| **G1** | G (ALT) | G (ALT) | AATAATT (REF) | Contains two missense mutations (S342G and I384M) on the same haplotype; high-risk. |
| **G2** | A (REF) | T (REF) | A (6 bp deletion) | In-frame deletion removing N388 and Y389; high-risk. |

### üß† Notes

- **G1** and **G2** are **mutually exclusive** haplotypes (do not occur together on the same chromosome).  
- **G1** is defined by rs73885319 (A‚ÜíG) and rs60910145 (T‚ÜíG).  
- **G2** is defined by the 6 bp deletion at rs71785313 (AATAATT‚ÜíA).  
- Individuals carrying **two risk haplotypes** (G1/G1, G2/G2, or G1/G2) are considered **high-risk** under a recessive model.  
- Coordinates correspond to the **GRCh38 (hg38)** reference genome.

### üß¨ Application : build G0 / G1 / G2

Using the table describing the **G0**, **G1**, and **G2** haplotypes and the corresponding **rsIDs**,  
and based on the results from the previous exercise,  
build for each individual their **APOL1 genotype** (combination of two haplotypes, e.g., G0/G1, G1/G1, G2/G0, etc.).

Then, classify individuals according to the **recessive risk model**,  
where those carrying **two risk haplotypes** (`G1/G1`, `G2/G2`, or `G1/G2`) are considered **high-risk**,  
and all others (`G0/G0`, `G0/G1`, `G0/G2`) are considered **low-risk**.

### üßæ Example of Expected Output

After computing the APOL1 genotypes for each individual using the variants  
`rs73885319`, `rs60910145`, and `rs71785313`,  
the resulting summary table could look like this:

| ID      | riskallele_h1 | riskallele_h2 | haplo_apol1 | high_risk |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| HG00096 | G1            | G0            | G1/G0       | 0         |
| HG00097 | G0            | G2            | G0/G2       | 0         |
| HG00099 | G1            | G1            | G1/G1       | 1         |


### üß† Notes

- **APOL1_G1** = 1 if the individual carries a G1 haplotype (based on rs73885319 + rs60910145), otherwise 0.  
- **APOL1_G2** = 1 if the individual carries a G2 haplotype (rs71785313 deletion), otherwise 0.  
- **Genotype** represents the combination of two haplotypes (e.g., `G0/G1`, `G1/G2`, `G2/G2`, etc.).  
- **HighRisk** = 1 (high-risk) if the individual carries **two risk haplotypes** (`G1/G1`, `G2/G2`, or `G1/G2`); otherwise 0 (low-risk).  
- This classification follows the **recessive risk model** commonly used in APOL1 studies.

---

## üìä Part. 3 Frequency Computation

### üß† Context


Genetic variant frequencies evolve over time under the influence of **demographic processes** (e.g., admixture, bottlenecks, migration) and **natural selection**.  
In the case of the **APOL1 gene**, the high-risk variants **G1** and **G2** arose in **West Africa** and were maintained by **positive selection** due to their roles in protection against *Trypanosoma brucei* parasites, which cause African sleeping sickness.

- **G1**: Confers **resistance to *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense*** infection, the agent of chronic sleeping sickness in West and Central Africa, although it may not be protective in other contexts.  
- **G2**: Is associated with **increased susceptibility to severe *T.b. gambiense*** disease but also with **reduced susceptibility to *T.b. rhodesiense***, which predominates in East Africa.  

As human populations migrated, mixed, and adapted to different selective pressures, the **distribution of G1 and G2 alleles** diverged geographically:
- **G1** is most frequent in **West Africa** (where *T.b. gambiense* is endemic).  
- **G2** occurs more commonly in **East Africa**, reflecting exposure to *T.b. rhodesiense*.  
- Outside Africa, both variants are **rare or absent**, consistent with the absence of trypanosome-driven selection.

Understanding how **APOL1 allele frequencies** vary between populations provides insights into:
- The **evolutionary history** of human adaptation to pathogens,  
- **Population structure** and migration events, and  
- The **distribution of kidney disease risk** across ancestries.

---

### üß¨ Applications

Using your dataset containing **individual IDs**, **ethnicity or population origin**, and **APOL1 genotype data** (`G0`, `G1`, `G2`):

1. **Group individuals by population or ancestry**  
   (e.g., African American, West African, East African, European, etc.).

2. **Compute allele frequencies** for each variant:
   - Frequency of **G1 alleles** (from `rs73885319` and `rs60910145`),  
   - Frequency of **G2 alleles** (from `rs71785313`),  
   - Optionally, compute **genotype frequencies** (e.g., `G0/G0`, `G0/G1`, `G1/G1`, `G0/G2`, `G1/G2`, `G2/G2`),  
   - Compare frequencies by **superpopulation** (e.g., AFR, EUR, EAS, AMR, SAS) and, when relevant, by **subpopulation**.

3. **Compare frequency differences** between populations to evaluate **allelic diversity**, **population differentiation**, and potential **selection signatures**.

---

#### üßæ Example of Output

| SuperPopulation | G0_freq | G1_freq | G2_freq |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|
| EUR             | 1.00     | 0.00     | 0.25     |
| AMR             | 0.50     | 1.00     | 0.25     |
| AFR             | 0.40     | 0.80     | 0.60     |

---

### üß† Notes

- **G1_freq** and **G2_freq** represent the proportion of alleles observed in each superpopulation.  
- **G0_freq** can be derived as `1 - (G1_freq + G2_freq)` when appropriate.  
- You may extend this to compute **high-risk genotype frequencies** (`G1/G1`, `G1/G2`, `G2/G2`) within or across populations.  
- Results should reflect known **geographic and selective patterns**:  
  - High **G1** frequency in **West Africa**,  
  - High **G2** frequency in **East Africa**,  
  - Near absence of both in **non-African** groups.

---




## üß¨ Supplementary Exercise: p.N264K

The **p.N264K** variant (**rs73885316**) is a **rare missense mutation** in the *APOL1* gene (Asparagine ‚Üí Lysine at position 264).  
Unlike the well-known **G1** and **G2** risk alleles, **p.N264K** is not itself associated with kidney disease risk ‚Äî rather, it appears to act as a **protective modifier**.

---

### üîç Context

- The **p.N264K** variant occurs in the **SRA-interacting domain** of APOL1, which is crucial for the protein‚Äôs trypanolytic activity.  
- Functional studies suggest that **p.N264K** can **reduce APOL1-mediated cytotoxicity** without fully compromising trypanosome resistance.  
- This variant tends to **co-occur on the same haplotype as G2**, and less commonly with G1, suggesting a possible **modifier effect** on G2-associated risk.  

**Key relationships:**
- üß© **p.N264K + G2** ‚Üí Often found together (on the same haplotype).  
- üî¨ **p.N264K + G1** ‚Üí Rare association.  
- üß´ **p.N264K + G0** ‚Üí Sometimes observed, usually in individuals of African ancestry without high-risk alleles.

---

### üåç Population Distribution

- **p.N264K** is observed **almost exclusively in African ancestry populations**.  
- The **highest frequencies** have been reported in **West and Central African populations**, though still typically **below 5%**.  
- It is **rare or absent** in **non-African** populations (e.g., European, Asian, or Native American).  
- Because it frequently occurs with **G2**, it shows slightly higher prevalence in regions where **G2** is common ‚Äî particularly in **East Africa**.

---

### üß† Application

Using your dataset that includes **p.N264K genotypes** (rs73885316) and **APOL1 G1/G2 status**:

1. **Determine** with which high-risk allele (G1 or G2) the p.N264K variant most frequently co-occurs.  
2. **Compute allele frequencies** of p.N264K by population or ancestry group.
